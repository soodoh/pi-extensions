# statusline

`statusline` is a lean, compact, powerline-style statusline for Pi.

This package was created to provide similar statusline-focused functionality to [`pi-powerline-footer`](https://github.com/nicobailon/pi-powerline-footer), while removing features unrelated to the statusline itself. It keeps the pieces I needed—model, git, provider, and context visibility—and intentionally leaves out broader UI features such as welcome overlays, vibes, stash flows, bash mode, presets, and slash-command controls.

## Highlights

- Renders a compact statusline below the editor.
- Shows the active model name.
- Shows the current git branch plus staged and unstaged change counts.
- Shows provider usage badges when the `provider_usage` section is configured and Pi exposes the relevant provider/auth data.
- Shows context usage as percentage plus context window, with warning colors above 70% and 90%.
- Indicates auto-compaction when Pi reports it as enabled.
- Adapts to terminal width by hiding less important provider detail first.
- Auto-detects Nerd Font-capable terminals and falls back to ASCII-safe symbols.

## Install

These packages are not published to npm. Use Pi's Git package source.

To install the whole repo package:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/soodoh/pi-extensions
```

To load only `statusline`, add a filtered package entry to `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` for a global install, or `.pi/settings.json` for a project-local install:

```json
{
  "packages": [
    {
      "source": "git:github.com/soodoh/pi-extensions",
      "extensions": ["packages/statusline/index.ts"],
      "skills": [],
      "prompts": [],
      "themes": []
    }
  ]
}
```

If you prefer SSH, use this source instead:

```text
git:git@github.com:soodoh/pi-extensions
```

Restart Pi or run `/reload` after installing.

## Usage

The extension activates automatically for sessions with a UI. It installs a below-editor widget named `pi-statusline` and keeps it refreshed as Pi emits session, agent, provider, model, input, tool, and compaction events.

There are no slash commands. The statusline is intentionally always-on once the extension is loaded.

## Statusline segments

The rendered line is width-aware and may omit provider detail in narrow terminals.

| Segment        | Description                                                                                                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Model          | Current Pi model name, with a shorter display for Claude model names.                                              |
| Git            | Branch name, staged `+n`, and unstaged `*n` markers. Untracked files still make the branch appear dirty.           |
| Provider usage | Usage or balance information for supported configured providers when configured and available.                     |
| Context        | Current context percentage and context window, colored normally below 70%, warning above 70%, and error above 90%. |

## Configuration

The statusline layout is configured with a `statusline.sections` array in Pi settings. It supports two formats:

### Multi-line layout (default)

Use a nested array where each inner array defines one line:

```json
{
  "statusline": {
    "sections": [["model", "git", "context"], ["provider_usage"]]
  }
}
```

The default layout renders two lines: model, git, and context on the first line, and provider usage on the second.

### Single-line layout

Use a flat array to render everything on one line:

```json
{
  "statusline": {
    "sections": ["model", "git", "provider_usage", "context"]
  }
}
```

Supported sections are `model`, `git`, `provider_usage`, and `context`. The statusline renders only the configured sections and preserves their order. Provider usage token/quota lookups only run when `provider_usage` is present.

For example, to show only context then model on a single line:

```json
{
  "statusline": {
    "sections": ["context", "model"]
  }
}
```

Or to put git on a separate line from the model:

```json
{
  "statusline": {
    "sections": [["model", "context"], ["git"]]
  }
}
```

Nerd Font detection can be overridden with an environment variable:

```bash
POWERLINE_NERD_FONTS=1 pi   # force Nerd Font icons
POWERLINE_NERD_FONTS=0 pi   # force ASCII-safe symbols
```

Without an override, the extension enables Nerd Font icons for common terminals such as Ghostty, iTerm, WezTerm, Kitty, and Alacritty.

## Notes

- Git status is fetched asynchronously with short-lived caches so rendering stays responsive.
- Running the `bash` tool invalidates git status so the line updates after filesystem changes.
- Provider usage is best-effort, only runs when the `provider_usage` section is configured, and depends on what Pi exposes for the selected model/provider and authentication method.
- The package intentionally does not persist presets or expose UI controls.

## Development

From the repository root:

```bash
bun run --filter statusline typecheck
bun run --filter statusline test
```
